European Marine Information System (EUMIS) repository

NETMAR aims to develop a pilot European Marine Information System (EUMIS)
for searching, downloading and integrating satellite, in situ and model data
from ocean and coastal areas. It will be a user-configurable system offering
flexible service discovery, access and chaining facilities using OGC, OPeNDAP
and W3C standards.

This git repo contains a set of portlets (system components) which are used
in EUMIS. All portlets are open source, licensed under GPL.
